====

`noide` is a web-based code editor built using Node.js.

It's a useful, lightweight editor that runs in the browser.

Instructions
============

`npm install noide -g`

Then cd to the directory you want to edit and execute

`noide`

Now point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

You should see a page something like this:

*** WARNING ***
================
If you'd like to try out this IDE that's great BUT USE CAUTION.

Ensure any code is backed up regularly.
I would not like it to be responsible for any work lost.

Also, there is no authentication or security built in. That is left to you. Do not run on a publicly accessible server/port.

Build
=====

To build `noide` you will need browserify and the less compiler installed:

`npm i browserify -g`

`npm i lessc -g`

Then it's `npm run build` in the directory you installed to.

This will compile the JavaScripts and Less files.

You will need to do this if you want to change the editors settings.

Settings for the editor can be found in `/config/client.js`.
You can change all the settings of the actual code editor in there. E.g. tabs, spaces and theme.
All the theme names can be found on here [ACE Editor](http://ace.c9.io/build/kitchen-sink.html).

To change the theme of noide you can find the less files in `client/bootstrap.less`.
The `themes` directory contains two themes a light and dark one. Others can be downloaded
from [bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com/) or just create your own.
